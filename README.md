# Espresso

Espresso keeps your computer awake from the system tray.

Launching Espresso creates a system tray (aka notification area) icon.  Click the icon to inhibit power management and keep your computer awake.  Click it again to return to normal.  Right-click to inhibit for a specific amount of time.  Middle-click to quit.

## Dependencies

### Linux

- Python 3
- PyQt5
- dbus-python

### Windows 7

- [Python 3](https://www.python.org/getit/)
- [PyQt5](https://www.riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt/download5)

## Motivation

Espresso is inspired by [Caffeine](http://lightheadsw.com/caffeine/) and uses the same icons as [Caffeine for Linux](https://launchpad.net/caffeine).  I wrote Espresso because Caffeine for Linux requires many unwanted dependencies including GTK3.
